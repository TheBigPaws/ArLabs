This application was made as a final project of the CMP404 module in 4th year of Abertay University. The submission report is also included for those interested.

AR is extremely dependant on the software within a phone, therefore there is a link to a list of devices and what they support:
https://developers.google.com/ar/devices

To run this application, it is necessary that the device has Depth API and ARCore.

This whole project was developed on a Google Pixel 4. 

Because hardware dependancy was not properly investigated yet, there is also a demonstration video online.
(application has sounds as well, however they have not been properly recorded, therefore I have added some background music - My Girls by Animal Collective)

I do not own any music, sound effects, models or other assets used in this application. The game functionality, however, is fully original.
