This application was made as a final project of the CMP404 module in 4th year of Abertay University. The submission report is also included for those interested.


This whole project was developed on a Google Pixel 4.
To run this application, it is necessary that the device has Depth API and ARCore. 

The exported, ready-to-run .apk file is available at the following link.

! Because hardware dependancy was not properly investigated yet, there is a high chance of encountering misaligned UI or other problems whern trying to run it on a different device. !
For this reason, a demonstration video is also available online.

(application has sounds as well, however they have not been properly recorded, therefore I have added some background music - My Girls by Animal Collective)



While the game functionality is fully original, I do not own any music, sound effects, models or other assets used in this application. Their proper references are written in the attached project report.
