This application was made as a final project of the CMP404 module in 4th year of Abertay University. In this folder, there is
a .apk executable file, which is ready to be deployed on an Android device.

This can be extremely dependant on the AR software within a phone, therefore there is a link to a list of devices and what they support:
https://developers.google.com/ar/devices

It is necessary that the device has Depth API and ARCore.

This whole project was developed on a Google Pixel 4. 

Because hardware dependancy was not properly investigated yet, there is also a demonstration video online, as well as within this repository.
(application has sounds as well, however they have not been properly recorded, therefore I have added some background music - My Girls by Animal Collective)


I do not own any music, sound effects, models or other assets used in this application. The game functionality, however, has been fully
developed by me.
